                        Apart from being one of the largest eagles in the world, it could be argued that the Philippine Eagle is also one of the most striking. It has a massive dark black bill with a tinge of blue, neon yellow feet, and pale gray-blue eyes.

                   Growing up as a kid and watching these movies over and over again  never made you realize that what there saying in the movie is so true. but as you get older you start to realize that these are the little motivation quotes that bring you up when your down.

                    The past may hurt but you can run from it or learn from it. Embrace it, grow through it but never run. you should run sometimes but that's not from your past but the memories that holds you to the past. . . . .move on and survive. I know you can.

                    Yesterday is History, Tomorrow is a Mystery But today is a Gift that is why it is called The Present. Life can be hard sometimes but there is always a light at the end so never give up on life or yourself remember there is always someone who cares so much about you.
